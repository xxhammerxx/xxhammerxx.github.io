      <p class="mycss">GETTING STARTED</p>
      <p>Which do you find first &#8211; the home design or the block of land?
      Why not talk to a Sales Consultant at one of our displays first. Discuss
      your family's needs and likes and we'll suggest suitable home designs as
      well as provide advice on a suitable block. Your Sales Consultant can
      ensure the home design you like will fit onto the block, before you go
      ahead and buy it.</p>
      <p>When looking for suitable blocks remember that gentle sloping or flat
      blocks are generally more preferable because they can be easier and more
      affordable to build on.</p>
      <p>If you have already bought a block of land, we'll provide advice on
      which home design will best suit your family on that block. Your Sales
      Consultant will discuss everything from the size of your home, the number
      of bedrooms, the size of each room, the outside appearance of your home,
      the alfresco area and so on.</p>
      <p>Alternatively to take the stress out of finding a block and then
      finding a home to suit that block you might consider one of the many home
      and land packages AllStyle Homes has on offer. Basically we'll take you
      through just about everything you need to consider when planning a home
      that's perfect for you and your family.</p>

      <p class="mycss">GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS</p>
      <p>Any one of AllStyle Home's standard plans can be modified to suit your
      family's specific requirements.Once you have settled on the plan that's
      right for you, your Sales Consultant will prepare a "Preliminary
      Estimate" which includes your changes to the standard design plus any
      site works required on your block.<br>
      Upon your approval of our Preliminary Estimate we will prepare a
      Preliminary Agreement.A fee paid at this stage is fully deductible from
      the final contract price of your home. This fee covers the following
      requirements:</p>

      <p>The completion of testing and surveys on your block allows AllStyle
      Homes to fix the price of site works in your contract &#8211; it's all
      part of our fixed price guarantee for your complete peace of mind.</p>

      <p class="mycss">PRE CONTRACT CHECK</p>
      <p>With all your changes finalized and formally documented, and
      associated prices fixed (including the price of site works), AllStyle
      Homes' Head Office will issue a "New Home Tender".<br>
      Your New Home Tender provides you with an opportunity to check that all
      your requests have been included before you proceed to signing a
      contract.Your Sales Consultant will go over the tender with you and
      address any questions or concerns you might have.</p>
      <p class="mycss">THE CONTRACT</p>
      <p>Once you are happy with the detail and have accepted the New Home
      Tender, your Sales Consultant will request a contract and working
      drawings from our Head Office. These documents will require your
      signature and will be countersigned by AllStyle Homes before an original
      set is returned to you for your records.</p>
      <p>If you are arranging finance, AllStyle Homes will electronically
      forward all the necessary documents (including a copy of your contract
      and plans) directly to your Lending Authority so they can prepare an
      "Authority to Commence Construction" letter, one of the important
      documents AllStyle Homes needs before construction of your home can
      commence.</p>
      <p class="mycss">APPROVALS</p>
      <p>In accordance with your contract, AllStyle Homes will prepare and
      lodge the relevant applications for approval by your Local Authority once
      your contract has been signed and the balance of your 5% deposit (i.e. 5%
      of the total contract value) has been paid. Your lender will be notified
      once AllStyle Homes have received your relevant approvals.</p>

        <img alt="divider" class="" src="../images/div5.png" title="Paragraph Divider.">
     </div>
      <p class="mycss">LIGHTING AND ELECTRICAL</p>
      <p>Once your applications have been lodged you can start on your lighting
      and electrical requirements. A trained consultant will assist you with
      your lighting and electrical plan at a free Clipspec consultation. You
      can attend this consultation in person or it can be conducted remotely
      over the internet and phone if required.</p>
      <p>During your Clipspec consultation you will see your electrical plan
      start coming to fruition on the screen in front of you as your consultant
      takes you through the rooms of your new home to discuss the various
      options. After your consultation, you'll get a copy of your house plans
      showing which products you've chosen and where everything needs to go
      &#8211; all ready for a trouble free installation.</p>
      <p class="mycss">CHOOSING YOUR FINISHES</p>
      <p>One of the most exciting aspects of building your own home is that you
      get to choose all the colors, fittings and fixtures to reflect your own
      family's personality, tastes and needs.<br>
      Having built thousands of homes since 1990 AllStyle Homes realizes that
      choosing the finishes for your new home can at times be daunting. That's
      why you'll have the opportunity to visit our trained consultant who is on
      hand to personally guide you through the process and provide expert
      advice to you on your selections.</p>
      <p>The consultant is trained and knows all the great range of the very
      latest products to choose from which means you can tailor your home
      perfectly with inclusions to suit your own needs, tastes and budget.
      Because at the end of the day it's all about ensuring you are completely
      happy with the products you have selected in your new home!</p>
      <div class="center">
        <img alt="divider" class="" src="../images/div5.png" title="Paragraph Divider.">
      </div>
      <p class="mycss">THE GREEN LIGHT</p>
      <p>The construction of your new home can commence once we have received
      the necessary documentation including relevant approvals and details of
      your finishes. You will be invited to attend the preparation of your
      house pad where you will meet your Building Supervisor, who will be your
      first point of contact during the construction process. You will be given
      contact details, including a mobile phone number, for your Building
      Supervisor and Construction Manager, both of whom are available to answer
      any questions you may have during construction.</p>
      <p>When the house pad has been prepared the concrete floor slab of your
      new home will be poured and construction will be well and truly under
      way. You are welcome to visit your new home throughout its construction.
      We'll even provide you with a key to access your home after "lock-up"
      stage (i.e. once it can be secured with locked doors) so you can continue
      to check on its progress.</p>
      <p class="mycss">HANDOVER TIME!</p>
      <p>"Handover" takes place when you finally receive the keys to your
      finished home and your dream becomes a reality! When all works are
      completed, you will be invited to attend a "final walkthrough" inspection
      of your home with your Building Supervisor. Together you will inspect
      your new home and discuss any items which need to be addressed before you
      move in. Once you're happy and all monies have been paid, your Building
      Supervisor will present you with the keys to your new home and you can
      crack open the bubbly!</p>
      <p class="mycss">SETTLING INTO YOUR NEW HOME</p>
      <p>You can rest assured that AllStyle Homes service to you will continue
      even after the construction process has finished. We are committed to
      helping you settle into your new home and to make this process a smooth
      and enjoyable one.<br>
      We will provide you with a maintenance service for the first six months
      after handover. During this time, all you need to do is record any items
      you feel need attention and we'll inspect and address these items at the
      end of the first six months in your new home.</p>
